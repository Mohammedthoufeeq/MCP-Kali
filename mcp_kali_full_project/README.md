# MCP-Kali Assistant (CLI)

**Educational / Authorized Use Only – Read Carefully**

This tool is a Python-based CLI assistant for **Kali Linux** that helps with:

- Basic reachability checks
- Nmap-based service discovery
- AI-guided enumeration strategy (via a local model running on a Windows host)
- Controlled execution of enumeration commands
- Per-target session tracking and Markdown reporting

It is inspired by an MCP-like auto-analysis workflow for **CTF labs and explicitly authorized penetration tests only**.
